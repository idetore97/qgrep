# qgrep

qgrep is a quantum computing project implemented in Qiskit that is intended to mimic the functionality of grep, but applying quantum algorithms. Grover's search is implemented under the hood. Included within is the text of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen and a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating its use.
